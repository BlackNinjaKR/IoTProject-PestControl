# IoT-Based Pest Detection System

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my first electronics project at NFSU for the Student Startup and Innovation Policy (SSIP) program. The project focuses on developing an **IoT-based Pest Detection System** to empower farmers with real-time monitoring of pests and insects in agricultural fields.

## Project Purpose

Pest infestation is a major challenge for farmers. Over-reliance on pesticides not only harms the environment but also leads to long-term inefficacy as pests become resistant. This project aims to reduce pesticide use by detecting pests early using sensors and providing actionable data to farmers.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno**: The brain of the system, used to control and gather data from various sensors.
- **Sound Sensors**: Capture pest acoustic signals that are often inaudible to humans.
- **Led Lights**: Used to indicate the output

## Key Features
- **Real-time Pest Monitoring**: Farmers can receive alerts based on pest activity.
- **Data Visualization**: The system displays real-time data on pest activity, allowing farmers to take timely actions.
- **Sustainability**: By minimizing pesticide usage, the project promotes environmentally friendly agricultural practices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/YourUsername/IoT-PestDetection.git
2. Install the necessary Arduino libraries for sensor integration.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage
- Connect the sensors to the Arduino board as per the provided circuit diagram.
- Upload the code to the Arduino.
- Use the serial monitor to view real-time sensor data.
- Integrate the system with IoT platforms to send alerts and monitor pest activity remotely.

## Future Scope
- **Expansion**: Integrating with other smart farming technologies to create a comprehensive IoT ecosystem for agriculture.
- **AI Integration**: Using machine learning to improve pest identification accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Expanding the system to monitor larger fields with minimal sensor adjustments.
